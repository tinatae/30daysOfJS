    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // NUMBERS
        let age = 100;
        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2);   // 100, 100
        age = 200;
        console.log(age, age2)    // 200, 100

      // SAME EXAMPLE FOR STRINGS
        let name = "Peanut";
        let name2 = name;
        console.log(name, name2)  // Peanut, Peanut
        name = "Butter";
        console.log(name, name2)  // Butter, Peanut

    // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Poppy', 'Peanut', 'Pickle', 'Popcorn'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

      team[3] = "Radish"
      console.log(players, team)    // UPDATES BOTH BC GOES BACK TO REFERENCE (WILL REFERENCE BACK

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // IF PASS NOTHING WILL RETURN COPY
    team2[3] = "Carrot"

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Willy Wonka',
      age: 100
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const character = person;
    character.number= 99;
    console.log(character)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12})
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (CUU)
    const cap3 = {...person}


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const flower = {
      name: 'Sunny', 
      age: 10,
      social: {
        twitter: '@sunnyflower',
        facebook: 'sunny.flower'
      }
    };

    const sunflower = Object.assign({}, flower)
    sunflower.age = 12;                             // THIS CHANGES FINE BC CLONES ONE LEVEL DEEP
    sunflower.social.twitter = '@rose'              // THIS CHANGES BOTH BC DEEP CLONE
    console.log(flower, sunflower)

    const flower2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(flower))  // 'POOR MAN'S' DEEP CLONE. SHAKES ALL THE REFERENCES & TURNS INTO STRING. THEN PARSES TO RETURN AS OBJECT
    flower2.social.facebook = 'copycat';
    console.log(flower2, flower)                        // ONLY flower2 facebook CHANGED


    

    // IF WANT TO CLONE DEEP, GO ONLINE & FIND FUNCTION 'clonedeep' THAT WILL CLONE AS DEEP AS WANT.
    // HOWEVER VERY RARELY NEED TO CLONE OBJECT THAT DEEP SO RECONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS
